Key Steps in Housing Data Cleaning through SQL:

1. Handling Missing Values:
Identify and handle missing values in columns related to crucial housing features, such as price, size, location, and amenities.
Use SQL queries to fill in missing values with appropriate defaults or interpolate values based on relevant criteria.

2.Ensuring Data Accuracy:
Detect and rectify inaccurate data entries, such as outliers, unrealistic values, or data inconsistencies that might impact the analysis.
Employ SQL queries to filter out or correct erroneous data points to enhance the overall accuracy of the dataset.

3.Standardizing Formats:
Standardize formats for categorical variables, ensuring consistent representations of data like property types, neighborhood names, and other descriptors.
Utilize SQL functions to transform and standardize data formats, making it easier to aggregate and analyze information.

4.Handling Duplicates:
Identify and eliminate duplicate records to prevent redundancy and ensure the integrity of the dataset.
Use SQL queries to identify and remove duplicate entries based on specific criteria, such as unique property identifiers or address information.

5.Addressing Data Integrity:
Check for referential integrity by verifying relationships between tables, especially if the dataset is sourced from multiple databases.
Use SQL constraints and relationships to maintain data integrity, ensuring that foreign keys align with primary keys.

6.Date and Time Formatting:
Standardize date and time formats to facilitate temporal analysis of housing trends.
Leverage SQL functions to convert and format date and time data consistently throughout the dataset.

7.Quality Assurance Checks:
Conduct comprehensive quality checks on the cleaned dataset to identify any residual issues.
Use SQL queries to perform data profiling and validation to ensure the dataset adheres to predefined quality standards.

By executing these steps through SQL, the Housing Data Cleaning process ensures that the dataset is well-prepared for subsequent analysis, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of the housing data for decision-making purposes.
